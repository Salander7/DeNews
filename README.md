DeNews is a daily news app built with SwiftUI that keeps you updated with articles across categories like General, Entertainment, Sports, Health, Science, and Technology, powered by the News API, and crafted with SwiftData and Swift's new Observation system.

This app is crafted entirely in Swift using SwiftUI. The project takes advantage of Swift's new Observation system, SwiftData for robust data persistence, and MainActor for efficient UI updates.

It adheres to the MVVM architecture and integrates with the NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/) to provide categorized news in sections like General, Entertainment, Sports, Health, Science, and Technology.

Users can search for articles, save them, and click to view full articles directly on their original websites.

For security, the API key is excluded using .gitignore; however, I can provide or guide you through setting it up if you'd like to see the app running.
